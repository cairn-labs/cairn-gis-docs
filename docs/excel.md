# Cairn Geographics Excel Documentation

## Installation

Download the Excel add-in from [the downloads page](www.cairngeographics.com/downloads).
You can install it temporarily by simply double clicking on the **CairnGeographics-AddIn.xll** file
in your downloads; if you install it this way then it will be removed when you close Microsoft Excel.

If you'd like to install it permanently, then go to **File** -> **Options**, and click on the
**Add-ins** category. In the Add-ins panel that appears, choose the **Manage** box, click
**Excel Add-ins**, and then click Go. Now choose **Browse** and navigate to the
**CairnGeographics-AddIn.xll** file that you downloaded. If you have any trouble, the
[Microsoft support page on Excel Add-ins](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-or-remove-add-ins-0af570c4-5cf3-4fa9-9b88-403625a0b460) can be helpful.

## Authentication

To use Cairn Geographics, you will first need an **API key** to identify your client to the central
geographic server. Your representative will provide you with an API key. Store it somewhere safe,
as it is your password to Cairn Geographics. It will be in a format that looks like
`CGIS-80c6d145-22ec-45da-a0fc-9f7e8666f062`.

If the Cairn Geographics Add-in has been installed correctly, there will be a new tab at the far right
of Excel's top ribbon called **Cairn Geographics**. Click on this tab, and there will be an input box
where you can paste your API Key. Paste your API Key into the box, and if it is accepted then the icon
will turn green and your remaining monthly queries will be displayed.
